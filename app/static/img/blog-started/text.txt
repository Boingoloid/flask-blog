So you’re ready to give marijuana a try.  This article will get you up to speed on what your options are and how to enjoy your experience, anxiety-free.  This is an overview to give you the lay of the land.  I’ve included links to dive down any rabbit holes you would like, but by the end of this article you’ll be ready to enjoy some herbs, with the confidence that you’re doing right.

Let’s get started.  First a note on saftey.

State of Mind: 
Enjoying cannabis is partly about putting yourself in a relaxing state of mind.  It is challenging to have a relaxing experience if you’re nervous about how a drug is going to impact your body.  So let’s address the question of safety right off the bat.

Is marijuana safe?  
Instead on giving you a firehose of science to the face (click for a fire-hose of science to the face): {{link}}), for the purposes of this overview, I just have some quick observations.  

Let’s compare the toxicity of Marijuana to other recreational drugs.  Below is data from a study conducted…. 
It takes the ratio of “fatal dose” to “effective dose” for a variety of recreational drugs.  Using alcohol as an example, a couple shots will give most people a “buzz”, but drink 10x that over a very short time period and you could be in serious health danger.  The higher the ratio, then the harder it is to “overdose” on the drug.   Notice "heroin” at the bottom with the lowest ratio of 5x.  Over doing it to a relatively small degree can be fatal. Alcohol, is only slightly better at 10x and worse than codeine, MDMA, and even cocaine at 15x.  Up at the top sits marijuana.  It is so difficult to overdose from Marijuana poisoning that no one has actually ever done it, hence the arrow and the “>” sign.

With that we have insight into how much safer marijuana is than alcohol and other drugs from a toxicity standpoint.
